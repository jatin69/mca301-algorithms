### Q1

Given order of n matrices, find the minimum multiplication operations required for multiplying n matrices.

------------

### Q2

From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm and bellmanâ€™s ford algorithm.

------------

### Q3

Implement N Queen's problem using Back Tracking.

### Q4

Suppose you are managing the construction of billboards on the university road, a heavily travelled stretch of road that runs west-east for M miles.

...........
Regulations imposed by the Delhi road authority require that no two billboards be
within less than or equal to 5 miles of each other. You had like to place billboards at
a subset of the sites so as to maximize your total revenue, subject to this restriction.

...........
Give an algorithm that takes an instance of this problem as input and returns the
maximum total revenue that can be obtained from any valid subsets of sites.

### Q5

Some of your friends have gotten into the burgeoning field of time-series data mining, in which one looks for patterns in sequences of events that occur over time. 

...........
Given a long sequence S of such events, your friends want an efficient way to detect certain "patterns" in them.

...........
Their goal is to be able to dream up short sequences and quickly detect whether they are subsequences of S.
Give an algorithm that takes two sequences of events S' of length m and S of length n, each possibly containing an event more than once and decides in time O (m + n) whether S' is a subsequence of S.
